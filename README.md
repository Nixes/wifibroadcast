# wifibroadcast
An unofficial github mirror of the project of the same name, from https://bitbucket.org/befi/wifibroadcast on 01/06/2016.
This project allows durable low latency transmission of hd video using off the shelf hardware.

All this is possible due to the amazing work of [befinitiv](https://befinitiv.wordpress.com/)

This is just the source code along with some random notes gathered from forums, usefull builds are found elsewhere. This repository was created to make a centralised source of documentation in the form of the wiki, and to allow use of githubs issue tracker.

Setup instructions here: https://befinitiv.wordpress.com/wifibroadcast-analog-like-transmission-of-live-video-data/wifibroadcast-fpv-manual-setup/

Expected latency: 80-150ms, depending on video quality
